<h5>What Is Reverse Engineering?</h5>
      <p>Engineering is the profession involved in designing, manufacturing, 
      constructing, and maintaining of products, systems, and structures. At a 
      higher level, there are two types of engineering: forward engineering and 
      reverse engineering.</p>
      <p>Forward engineering is the traditional process of moving from 
      high-level abstractions and logical designs to the physical implementation 
      of a system. In some situations, there may be a physical part without any 
      technical details, such as drawings, bills-of-material, or without 
      engineering data, such as thermal and electrical properties.</p>
      <p>The process of duplicating an existing component, subassembly, or 
      product, without the aid of drawings, documentation, or computer model is 
      known as reverse engineering. </p>
      <p>Reverse engineering can be viewed as the process of analyzing a system 
      to:</p>
      <p>
      </p><ol>
        <li>Identify the system's components and their interrelationships 
        </li><li>Create representations of the system in another form or a higher 
        level of abstraction 
        </li><li>Create the physical representation of that system </li></ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>Reverse engineering is very common in such diverse fields as software 
      engineering, entertainment, automotive, consumer products, microchips, 
      chemicals, electronics, and mechanical designs. For example, when a new 
      machine comes to market, competing manufacturers may buy one machine and 
      disassemble it to learn how it was built and how it works. A chemical 
      company may use reverse engineering to defeat a patent on a competitor's 
      manufacturing process. In civil engineering, bridge and building designs 
      are copied from past successes so there will be less chance of 
      catastrophic failure. In software engineering, good source code is often a 
      variation of other good source code.</p>
      <p>In some situations, designers give a shape to their ideas by using 
      clay, plaster, wood, or foam rubber, but a CAD model is needed to enable 
      the manufacturing of the part. As products become more organic in shape, 
      designing in CAD may be challenging or impossible. There is no guarantee 
      that the CAD model will be acceptably close to the sculpted model. Reverse 
      engineering provides a solution to this problem because the physical model 
      is the source of information for the CAD model. This is also referred to 
      as the part-to-CAD process.</p>
      <p>Another reason for reverse engineering is to compress product 
      development times. In the intensely competitive global market, 
      manufacturers are constantly seeking new ways to shorten lead-times to 
      market a new product. Rapid product development (RPD) refers to recently 
      developed technologies and techniques that assist manufacturers and 
      designers in meeting the demands of reduced product development time. For 
      example, injection-molding companies must drastically reduce the tool and 
      die development times. By using reverse engineering, a three-dimensional 
      product or model can be quickly captured in digital form, re-modeled, and 
      exported for rapid prototyping/tooling or rapid manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Following are reasons for reverse engineering a part or product:</p>
      <p>
      </p><ol>
        <li>The original manufacturer of a product no longer produces a product 
        </li><li>There is inadequate documentation of the original design 
        </li><li>The original manufacturer no longer exists, but a customer needs the 
        product 
        </li><li>The original design documentation has been lost or never existed 
        </li><li>Some bad features of a product need to be designed out. For example, 
        excessive wear might indicate where a product should be improved 
        </li><li>To strengthen the good features of a product based on long-term 
        usage of the product 
        </li><li>To analyze the good and bad features of competitors' product 
        </li><li>To explore new avenues to improve product performance and features 
        </li><li>To gain competitive benchmarking methods to understand competitor's 
        products and develop better products 
        </li><li>The original CAD model is not sufficient to support modifications or 
        current manufacturing methods 
        </li><li>The original supplier is unable or unwilling to provide additional 
        parts 
        </li><li>The original equipment manufacturers are either unwilling or unable 
        to supply replacement parts, or demand inflated costs for sole-source 
        parts 
        </li><li>To update obsolete materials or antiquated manufacturing processes 
        with more current, less-expensive technologies </li></ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>Reverse engineering enables the duplication of an existing part by 
      capturing the component's physical dimensions, features, and material 
      properties. Before attempting reverse engineering, a well-planned 
      life-cycle analysis and cost/benefit analysis should be conducted to 
      justify the reverse engineering projects. Reverse engineering is typically 
      cost effective only if the items to be reverse engineered reflect a high 
      investment or will be reproduced in large quantities. Reverse engineering 
      of a part may be attempted even if it is not cost effective, if the part 
      is absolutely required and is mission-critical to a system.</p>
      <p>Reverse engineering of mechanical parts involves acquiring 
      three-dimensional position data in the point cloud using laser scanners or 
      computed tomography (CT). Representing geometry of the part in terms of 
      surface points is the first step in creating parametric surface patches. A 
      good polymesh is created from the point cloud using reverse engineering 
      software. The cleaned-up polymesh, NURBS (Non-uniform rational B-spline) 
      curves, or NURBS surfaces are exported to CAD packages for further 
      refinement, analysis, and generation of cutter tool paths for CAM. 
      Finally, the CAM produces the physical part.</p>
      <p>It can be said that reverse engineering begins with the product and 
      works through the design process in the opposite direction to arrive at a 
      product definition statement (PDS). In doing so, it uncovers as much 
      information as possible about the design ideas that were used to produce a 
      particular product.</p>
